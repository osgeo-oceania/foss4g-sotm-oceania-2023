# Product Showcase

We are all hear to be inspired, but lurking behind each and everyone of us are our brilliant products that imbibe the essence of how we tell stories. 
<br /><br />
Well we say, **Let's share them!**<br /><br />

Using [Soar.Earth](https://soar.earth/), the latest digital atlas used by BBC, Washington Post, Cartographic Artists and Enthusiasts, we can collect and showcase the talent of Oceania. <br /><br />
## Prizes for top 3!
Along with Soar.Earth, the conference committee will select the top 3 entries and award them some great prizes courtesy of Soar.Earth at the Conference Closing Ceremony. <br /><br />

> All products tagged with 
>  **FOSS4G-Oceania2023**  
> will be in the running!
