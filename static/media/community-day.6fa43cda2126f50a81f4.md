# Community Day

FOSS4G conferences have a tradition of hosting a community day/code sprint after the conference. State of the Map conferences have similar traditions, often including an OpenStreetMap mapathon. Our community day is open to everyone from novice to expert. It is a melting pot of ideas where project insiders meet users and each helps the other. There's always plenty to do â€“ it's not only about programming and/or street-mapping.
<br /><br />
The Community Day will be held Friday 20th Oct 2023. We will be starting at 9am and finishing at 5pm.
<br /><br />
Registration at the conference is not a prerequisite for participation in the Community Day. Participation in the Community Day is free of charge and all folks interested in giving back to geospatial open source and open data communities are welcome.
<br /><br />

## How is the Community Day (Friday 20th Oct 2023) different from the Workshop Day (Monday 16th oct 2023)?
The Community Day is a free, informal event led by participants with shared interests in a particular topic. The emphasis of the day is to give inspired individuals a chance to meet and share their open geospatial knowledge, such as sharing code, troubleshooting problems, or helping beginners tackle problems they have encountered.
<br /><br />
Workshops are structured events led by one or more instructors to learn specific tasks or to teach specific skills. Workshops require registration and cost to attend. There is a limited number of places for each workshop. Community day is open to all. 
<br /><br />
If you are interested in leading a community day event, send us an email with your thoughts to the [program team](mailto:program@foss4g-oceania.org).

### Mapathon
Hosted by the team at [OpenMappingHub Asia Pacific](https://www.hotosm.org/hubs/open-mapping-hub-asia-pacific), this day is an opportunity to jump into mapping a current campaign. Come along regardless of your experience. If you have never joined in one of these, this is a great opportunity to learn how it is done by those in the know!

### Product Development Session: OS Story Maps 
We are looking for ways to streamline creating Story Maps in FOSS4G with current products or to design an outline for a new product or plugin. This is currently an area lacking in FOSS4G and whilst there are some products out there, they mostly require payment or have limited functionality. If we can come out of this with our requirements, we could then understand the resource requirements and build a crowdfunding exercise.

 Our Goals <br />
- What elements do we require? The base would include media, text, and map. However, perhaps we want to be able to view it 3d or create some dashboard like features. <br />
- What should their behaviour be? Think about what is currently out there - what do you like, what is missing & etc. We want to progress further than a map and an information box side-by-side. <br />
- What should the base platform be? Think here about the resources for continual maintenance, accessibility, logic, ease of use. What currently offers this, could we approach them to build up their product with our requirements? Would be be able to roll what is available out there into the QGIS platform to allow for ongoing technical support? <br />
