# Present
We are pleased to open our Call for Presentations and Workshops. FOSS4G SotM Oceania brings geospatial professionals, software developers and users from around the region, for 5 days of workshops, talks and activities.
<br /><br />

> Call for presentations are now CLOSED! We are now in the Voting period. 

<br />

## Call for Presentations and Lightning talks

We want you to share your fascinating stories about open source geospatial, open data, and open street map in Oceania. We welcome all levels of expertise, from highly technical to end user, and from academic, professional and community projects, on subjects related to Free and Open Source GIS, Open Street Map, and publication and use of open data. Remember, your talk will need to represent either a project about Oceania, or you yourself are representing the Oceania region. If you reside outside the region, ensure your presentation applies to Oceania's needs. 
<br /><br />
- **Presentations** are limited to 20 minutes of content with 5 minutes for questions. Presentations are delivered in consecutive sessions over the three conference days Tuesday Oct 17th to Thursday Oct 20th.
<br /><br />
- **Lightning talks** are rapid presentations strictly limited to 5 mins. Lightning talks are presented back-to-back with several other speakers, and provide a good opportunity to share smaller projects, anecdotes or lighthearted content in an informal session. Lightning talks are delivered over the three conference days Tuesday Oct 17th to Thursday Oct 20th either in final session or during the unconference session on Wednesday morning. 
<br /><br />
**All applications must be received by midnight 14th July (NZ Standard Time).**
Once community voting has been completed, successful applications will be notified in the first week of August. If you are successful in your application, you will still need to purchase a conference ticket and hopefully you get in before the early-bird tickets close!

### Tips for speakers
The OSGeo community is characterized for its dynamic way of growing and we are proud of welcoming a variety of voices and ideas. If you are considering sending a proposal to our call for papers, consider the following:
<br /><br />
- FOSS4Gâ€™s backbone is free and open source, so make sure you clearly indicate what is (are) the open source project(s) essential in your talk
- If you present new developments or a completely new open source project, make sure you point to its repository(ies) so people can follow up. You can add in links to your submission.
- Add in a photo of yourself and for your presentation. We will link to your presentation from the schedule page and list you as a speaker as per the [2019 FOSS4G SOTM Oceania conference](https://2019.foss4g-oceania.org/speakers/).
- Topics should be either from Oceania residents, or on projects that concern or can align with Oceania. 
- When filling in your submission, please let us know your relationship with Oceania e.g. I live in Oceania, this project is about Oceania, this project applies to Oceania, I was born in Oceania but now I am a bigwig in San Fran & etc 
- Check out these [past presentations including lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/@foss4gsotmoceania433/videos) for inspiration.

### What we expect from you as a speaker

We believe in equality, so all presenters have the same exact amount of time to present their work, according to their contribution type. Please consider that when preparing your slides and be mindful about the time. A bell will be used to indicate time reached and we expect presenters to comply with it. Practice your presentation in the car, the shower or to your cat. All presentations will need be uploaded prior to the conference, so get cracking!
And last, but not least, the success of this event lies in the responsible actions of all participants and organizers alike. If after you have confirmed participation, you or the co-authors are no longer able to present, please let us know as soon as possible.
