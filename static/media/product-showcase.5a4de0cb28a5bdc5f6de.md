# Product Showcase

We are all hear to be inspired, but lurking behind each and everyone of us are our brilliant products that imbibe the essence of how we tell stories. 
<br /><br />
Well we say, **Let's share them!**<br /><br />

Using [Soar.Earth](https://soar.earth/), the latest digital atlas used by BBC, Washington Post, Cartographic Artists and Enthusiasts, we can collect and showcase the talent of Oceania. <br /><br />
## Prizes for top 3!
Along with Soar.Earth, the conference committee will select the top 3 entries and award them some great prizes courtesy of Soar.Earth at the Conference Closing Ceremony. <br /><br />

> Make sure you tag your map with  <br />
    > **FOSS4G-Oceania2023** <br />
> to be in the running for some great prizes! 


## What to upload? 
- Projects: upload a map or image perhaps in the location of the project. In the comments, apply any links such as a website.
- Maps
- Imagery
- Earth Art  <br />
**N.B.** All uploads to be considered must have been somehow manipulated by the author i.e. an uploaded satellite image with no manipulation will not be considered. We want it to tell a geographical story curated by yourself. 

<br />

4. In the `Description` provide the story behind your project and add in any links - particularly if an online web-mapping application is available.
