## Session MCs
Session MCs are integral to running a successful conference. <br />
They are responsible for:
- **Setting the tone of sessions:** Engage your audience to be open to what they are about to hear. Add your passion. 
- **Managing the speakers:** Ensuring all the talks are loaded and ready to go. The program team will have done most of this, but best to check it.
- **Tech support:** Help the speakers with any tech issues.
- **Introducing the speakers:** Give a quick bio and introduce the talk.
- **Inviting and moderating the questions:** at the end of the talk there is 5 minutes for questions. The MC is to entice the audience to ask questions and should have back up questions themselves if the audience is quite shy. 
- **Ensuring the talks start on time and finish on time:** Yes, you will be the TimeLord for a session. Talks start on time, not before it, but on the time. This makes sure if  people are moving between rooms, they don't miss the start. You will have a bell to give 5 minutes warning at the 15 minute mark. Talks are for 20 minutes with a 5 minute question time at the end of the talk. 
<br /><br />

Once we have confirmed your MC spot, we will send you more detailed instructions but the main actions you will need to do are: 
- Make contact with your speakers - either before the conference or at the Icebreaker
- Meet your speakers 10min before the session
- Get them micced up
- Make sure you speak into the speakers (otherwise we will lose you in the YouTubes)
- Get acquainted with the tech as you will be troubleshooting any issues
- You will have a Student Volunteer who will be your runner if you need help
- Ring that bell
- Be the TimeLord
