# Workshops

Workshops are a great way to get practical experience in a hands-on session, guided by expert practitioners and project developers. 

<br />
### Call for Proposals

If you're passionate about a topic and you're skillful at conveying your hands-on knowledge and
experience to others, this is for you!
<br /><br />
Workshops are a great opportunity to pass on your knowledge to our enthusiastic community
