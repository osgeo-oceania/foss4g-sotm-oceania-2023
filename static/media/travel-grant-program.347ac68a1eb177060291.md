# Travel Grant Program

The Travel Grant Program (TGP) is aimed at increasing the diversity,
impact, and reach of the conference. We are looking for worthy recipients
who are committed to make an impact with the opportunity provided, and
we want to stretch our limited budget as widely as possible.

The TGP is administered by the Conference Committee (CC) and supported by OSGeo Oceania.
