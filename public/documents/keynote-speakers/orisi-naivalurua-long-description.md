Orisi Naivalurua is currently a Technical and Research Officer at the Pacific Community (SPC); under the Disaster Community Resilience Program (DCRP), which sits under the Geoscience, Energy & Maritime (GEM) Division. His experience in Pacific Island countries (PICs) has revolved around assisting country stakeholders in updating national risk information in an effort to assist PICs in making accurate risk-informed decisions. Under the Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment & Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) Project, he and his team have worked with PICs to help update risk data in the Pacific Risk Information System (PacRIS) through in-country exposure and impact surveys, whilst introducing and utilizing open-sourced tools.

With a continued focus on hard-work, perseverance and the right attitude, Orisi has been able to put his background knowledge in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), disaster risk knowledge, and climate change to good use. When heâ€™s not in the office, Orisi enjoys his time outdoors; whether on a field playing a game of rugby, or in the farm investing/tilling the land. His passion is in building the next generation and setting the right foundational principles (in whatever aspect it may be) with education, proper guidance, continuous support and sensitive encouragement over the young leaders of tomorrow.

## Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment & Financing Initiative II (PCRAFII) Project

<br/>

The Pacific Catastrophic Risk & Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) was established in 2006 to address disaster risk finance and insurance in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Over the years, the initiative underwent two phases, with Phase I commencing in 2007 and Phase II in 2016/2019. Between 2019 and 2023, the Pacific Community collaborated with five countries to enhance the Pacific Risk Information System (PacRIS) through the Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for PCRAFI Project. This effort aimed to bolster disaster risk finance and insurance capabilities in PICs by utilizing open-source tools to conduct exposure data surveys, analysis, and validation. The project's workflow, outcomes, and lessons learned are presented, along with examples of how these tools were integrated into core activities by country representatives. The work's continuity and expansion through projects like PARtneR highlight its contribution to regional risk assessment and disaster finance preparedness.
