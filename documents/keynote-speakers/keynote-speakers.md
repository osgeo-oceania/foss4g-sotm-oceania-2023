## Orisi Naivalurua <br/>
Orisi Naivalurua is currently a Technical and Research Officer at the Pacific Community (SPC); under the Disaster Community Resilience Program (DCRP), which sits under the Geoscience, Energy & Maritime (GEM) Division. His experience in Pacific Island countries (PICs) has revolved around assisting country stakeholders in updating national risk information in an effort to assist PICs in making accurate risk-informed decisions. Under the Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment & Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) Project, he and his team have worked with PICs to help update risk data in the Pacific Risk Information System (PacRIS) through in-country exposure and impact surveys, whilst introducing and utilizing open-sourced tools.<br/>
With a continued focus on hard-work, perseverance and the right attitude, Orisi has been able to put his background knowledge in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), disaster risk knowledge, and climate change to good use. When he’s not in the office, Orisi enjoys his time outdoors; whether on a field playing a game of rugby, or in the farm investing/tilling the land. His passion is in building the next generation and setting the right foundational principles (in whatever aspect it may be) with education, proper guidance, continuous support and sensitive encouragement over the young leaders of tomorrow.

## Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment & Financing Initiative II (PCRAFII) Project <br/>
This presentation will present on how the project worked with countries to use open-source tools for the exposure data mapping and the validation and quality assurance process through to the uploading of data on the open-source platform PacRIS. The workflow and the results from the project will be presented, as well as the lessons learnt that were captured in the follow up evaluations with each country. Examples of how the country representatives have taken the tools land also utilised them for their core work will also be presented. The presentation will also show how this work is being built upon by other projects such as PARtneR to further build the regions capabilities in risk assessment contributing to disaster and finance risk in the region.  <br/>

## Ueakeia Tofinga <br/>
Ueakeia hails from Tarawa, Kiribati and is the founder and former chairperson of the Kiribati Women in Mapping organization. Back in 2019, Ueakeia started using open source geospatial/OSM, when she realized how important OSM and open source geospatial is in decision making and development. She was led to the open-source geospatial community by the desire of maintaining and building on her geospatial skills, and to be around her kind of people. Ueakeia is currently a student of the University of Queensland, pursuing a Master in Geospatial Information Science. In 2021 was appointed to the She Lead, She Inpires program established by Humanitarian OSM Team's Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific.

## Jeremy Palmer <br/>
Jeremy is the Director Data at Toitū Te Whenua Land Information New Zealand and has been using FOSS4G since 2003! His journey into using open source geospatial began in 2003 when I was working on a data management project for his agency. He was struggling with finding a suitable solution for managing large geospatial dataset until he discovered PostGIS, an open source geospatial database. He was so surprised by the dedication of the developers who worked tirelessly to help him solve his problems, even if the software didn't originally support his need. This discovery opened up a whole new world of possibilities for him, as he realised the potential of open source and open data to transform geospatial analysis and make it more accessible to everyone. 
As he continued to explore the open source geospatial community, he found himself drawn to the collaborative and innovative spirit of the community. The open source geospatial community was passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and he knew that he wanted to be a part of that movement. 
He is the recipient of various personal and team awards including: Personal Achievement - Winner of the ‘New Professional of the Year’ award at the 2013 Institute of Public Administration New Zealand (IPANZ) Public Sector Excellence Awards; LINZ Data Service - Winner of the ‘Spatial Enablement’ category and the JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence at the Asia-Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards (APSEA) 2012 (Manager of the LINZ Data Service); and LINZ Data Service - Winner of the Geospatial Application Excellence Award in Infrastructure, Geospatial World Awards in Geneva 2014  (Manager of the LINZ Data Service)

## Mapping the Future: The Intersection of Geospatial, Open Source, and Open Data<br/>
The New Zealand government commitment to open geospatial data and services has helped unlocked the full potential of geospatial data and analysis, empowering innovators to create accessible services that benefit all. With open source and open data, developers and user can tackle complex issues such as urban development, climate change, resilience, Māori prosperity, and New Zealanders' wellbeing with new approaches. <br/>
