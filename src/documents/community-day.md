# Community Day

FOSS4G conferences have a tradition of hosting a community day/code sprint after the conference. State of the Map conferences have similar traditions, often including an OpenStreetMap mapathon. Our community day is open to everyone from novice to expert. It is a melting pot of ideas where project insiders meet users and each helps the other. There's always plenty to do – it's not only about programming and/or street-mapping.
<br /><br />
The Community Day will be held Friday 20th Oct 2023. We will be starting at 9am and finishing at 5pm.
<br /><br />
Registration at the conference is not a prerequisite for participation in the Community Day. Participation in the Community Day is free of charge and all folks interested in giving back to geospatial open source and open data communities are welcome.
<br /><br />

### How is the Community Day (Friday 20th Oct 2023) different from the Workshop Day (Monday 16th oct 2023)?
The Community Day is a free, informal event led by participants with shared interests in a particular topic. The emphasis of the day is to give inspired individuals a chance to meet and share their open geospatial knowledge, such as sharing code, troubleshooting problems, or helping beginners tackle problems they have encountered.
<br /><br />
Workshops are structured events led by one or more instructors to learn specific tasks or to teach specific skills. Workshops require registration and cost $50 per half day. There is a limited number of places for each workshop.
<br /><br />
