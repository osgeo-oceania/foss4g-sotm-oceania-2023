# Conference Logo Design Competition
## Design a logo for the FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2024 Conference

The FOSS4G SotM Oceania Organising Committee is pleased to announce a call for logo designs. We need your help to build a strong recognisable logo for FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2024 in Hobart, 5th to 8th November 2024.

Check out the Design Brief below (borrowing from the SotM) that outlines what we are looking for in a logo. Entrants could be an individual or team of people, even a design company.

By submitting a logo, you will be assigning an open license to OSGeo Oceania so that it can be used across different mediums. The organising committee may also commission improvements of the winning work. 

**Entries need to submitted by Friday 10th May 2024**

The community will vote to decide which logo wins.

## Inspiration
Some examples of past logos can be found below and there are several more examples on the [global FOSS4G website](https://foss4g.org/).

## Prize

The winning entry will receive a full conference registration, a conference dinner ticket and swag with the logo!

## Distribution

The logo will appear in the conference website, social media, flyers, emails, sponsor communications, t-shirts and potentially other conference ‘swag’ like bags, keychains, pens etc. Printed material at the conference such as timetable of talks, notebooks, banners and conference guide. Potentially small web-based button images for use on third party websites to promote the conference or fact that someone is speaking there, for placement on blogs and other web pages.

## Design Brief

### The design MUST

* Include elements of the OSGeo / FOSS4G “ribbon” as can be seen in all previous FOSS4G conference logos

* Include themes for Oceania and/or the hosting location (Hobart, Australia)
* Be easily printable on t-shirts with as few colours as possible. This keeps the cost of printing down.
* Work well on different coloured backgrounds (or have alternatives for light and dark backgrounds).
* Be delivered in PNG file format and a scalable format (SVG or PDF).
* Be different from other mapping conference logos (Where 2.0, ESRI, SotM…)
* Not communicate the brand of potential sponsors or related companies
* Not include copyrighted material that is not yours

### The design MAY

* Come in different sizes (example: a main logo and a variant for use on small print media such as badges).

### The design should communicate

* Geospatial / mapping concepts
* The potential of free and open source geospatial tools
* A sense of learning and education
* A sense of community
* Openness
* Intelligence
* Trustworthiness
* Global movement

### The design should not communicate

* Corporate / big business (as the sole element)
* Complexity
* Expensive
* For geeks only
* Closed community
