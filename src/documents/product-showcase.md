# Product Showcase

We are all hear to be inspired, but lurking behind each and everyone of us are our brilliant products that imbibe the essence of how we tell stories. 
<br /><br />
Well we say, **Let's share them!**<br /><br />

Using [Soar](https://soar.earth/), the latest digital atlas used by BBC, Washington Post, Cartographic Artists and Enthusiasts, we can collect and showcase the talent of Oceania. <br /><br />
## Prizes for top 3!
Along with Soar, the conference committee will select the top 3 entries and award them some great prizes courtesy of Soar at the Conference Closing Ceremony. <br /><br />

> Make sure you tag your map with  <br />
    > **FOSS4G-Oceania2023** <br />
> to be in the running for some great prizes!
> Prizes will be award at the Closing Ceremony so you have until midnight on 18th October Wednesday night to enter.

## What to upload? 
- Projects: upload a map or image perhaps in the location of the project. In the comments, apply any links such as a website.
- Maps
- Imagery
- Earth Art  <br />
**N.B.** All uploads to be considered must have been somehow manipulated by the author i.e. an uploaded satellite image with no manipulation will not be considered. We want it to tell a geographical story curated by yourself. 

<br />
## How to load up your project on Soar
1. If you haven't already set up a User Account, head to [Soar](https://soar.earth/) to set one up.
2. Create your map/layer/raster. The CRS used by Soar is EPSG:3857 WGS84 Pseudo-Mercator.
3. If you are creating it in **QGIS**, use the`Soar Plugin` via the `QGIS Plugins Manager`. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://about.soar.earth/blog-pages/installing-and-using-soars-qgis-plugin).
4. In the `Description` provide the story behind your project and add in any links - particularly if an online web-mapping application is available.
5. Make sure you use the `Tag` FOSS4G-Oceania2023 to be in the running for the prizes!
