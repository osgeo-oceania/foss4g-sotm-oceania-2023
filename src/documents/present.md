## Call for Presentations and Lightning talks

We want you to share your fascinating stories about open source geospatial, open data, and open street map in Oceania. We welcome all levels of expertise, from highly technical to end user, and from academic, professional and community projects, on subjects related to Free and Open Source GIS, Open Street Map, and publication and use of open data. Remember, your talk will need to represent either a project about Oceania, or you yourself are representing the Oceania region. If you reside outside the region, ensure your presentation applies to Oceania's needs.
<br /><br />
- **Presentations** are limited to 20 minutes of content with 5 minutes for questions. Presentations are delivered in consecutive sessions over the three conference days Tuesday Oct 17th to Thursday Oct 20th.
<br /><br />
- **Lightning talks** are rapid presentations strictly limited to 5 mins. Lightning talks are presented back-to-back with several other speakers, and provide a good opportunity to share smaller projects, anecdotes or lighthearted content in an informal session. Lightning talks are delivered over the three conference days Tuesday Oct 17th to Thursday Oct 20th either in final session or during the unconference session on Wednesday morning.
<br /><br />
**All applications must be received by midnight 14th July (NZ Standard Time).**
Once community voting has been completed, successful applications will be notified in the first week of August. If you are successful in your application, you will still need to purchase a conference ticket and hopefully you get in before the early-bird tickets close!

### What we expect from you as a speaker

We believe in equality, so all presenters have the same exact amount of time to present their work, according to their contribution type. Please consider that when preparing your slides and be mindful about the time. A bell will be used to indicate time reached and we expect presenters to comply with it. Practice your presentation in the car, the shower or to your cat. All presentations will need be uploaded prior to the conference, so get cracking!
And last, but not least, the success of this event lies in the responsible actions of all participants and organizers alike. If after you have confirmed participation, you or the co-authors are no longer able to present, please let us know as soon as possible.
