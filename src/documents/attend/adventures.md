# Tasmanian Adventures

This page is an opinionated list of things to do while you're in Tasmania. We'll start small
and end with some longer adventures.

## Less than a day

### MONA

Go to [MONA](https://mona.net.au/visit). This is pretty much required. You'll need
around half a day and if you can spare the money, take the return ferry from
Salamanca. Get lunch out there, explore the museum, pay extra for little side
adventures and get lost in the tunnels or laze about on the lawn. There's
usually Jazz on a Saturday afternoon.

### Mount Wellington/kunanyi

You can drive to the top and catch some fantastic views, but take a jumper as it's
always cold. About halfway up is called the Springs, and there are a whole bunch
of [short and long walks](https://tastrails.com/category/location/hobart-and-surrounding/wellington-park/)
from here. There are tourist buses and bike hiring things, but you can just catch
a ride with someone and explore too. Beware that clouds like to hug the top of the
mountain from time to time, just look up when you are in the city and if the peak
looks clear it's time to go!

### Salamanca Market

If you're in Hobart on a Saturday morning, don't miss the
[Salamanca Market](https://www.salamancamarket.com.au/). This vibrant market features
local produce, crafts, and food stalls. It's a great place to experience Tasmanian
culture and pick up unique souvenirs.

## Day trips from Hobart

### Mount Field National Park

[Mount Field National Park](https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/mount-field-national-park)
is a great day trip from Hobart, offering a variety of
hiking trails through lush rainforests, alpine meadows, and past stunning waterfalls
like Russell Falls. It's a perfect introduction to Tasmania's diverse landscapes.
The low part of the park offers easy and beautiful walks through the rainforest,
but if you are looking for something more challenging you can drive to the top
and take your pick from a range of stunning mountain hikes.

### Huon Valley

The [Huon Valley](https://www.huonvalleytas.com/), just south of Hobart, is known for its apple orchards, vineyards,
and artisanal producers. Take a scenic drive through the countryside, stopping at
farm gates, cider houses, and charming towns like Cygnet and Geeveston. Don't miss
the Tahune AirWalk for a bird's-eye view of the Huon River and surrounding forests.

### Tasman Peninsula

The [Tasman Peninsula](https://tasmania.com/points-of-interest/tasman-peninsula/),
southeast of Hobart, is known for its dramatic sea cliffs, historic
Port Arthur, and the Three Capes Track. Cruise along the coast to spot wildlife like seals
and whales, explore the ruins of the former convict settlement, admire impressive geological
formations such as the Tasman Arch and the Tessellated pavement, and hike a section of the
Three Capes Track for stunning views of the peninsula's rugged beauty.

### Freycinet National Park

[Freycinet National Park](https://parks.tas.gov.au/explore-our-parks/freycinet-national-park),
located on the east coast, is famous for its stunning
beaches, including Wineglass Bay, often rated among the world's best beaches.
The park offers a variety of hiking trails, including the popular Wineglass Bay
Lookout walk, which provides breathtaking views. You can also enjoy kayaking,
snorkeling, and wildlife spotting.

## Longer Experiences

### Bruny Island

Bruny Island, accessible by a short ferry ride from Kettering, is a microcosm
of Tasmania's natural beauty. Spot wildlife like the white wallaby, explore
the rugged coastline, and sample local produce like cheese, oysters, and fudge.
The Neck Lookout and the Fluted Cape hike are must-dos.

### Cradle Mountain and Deloraine

Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park is home to the famous Overland Track,
a challenging multi-day hike through alpine landscapes. Even if you don't tackle
the full track, there are plenty of shorter walks to enjoy the park's highlights,
like Dove Lake and Cradle Mountain itself. Nearby Deloraine is a charming town
with a thriving arts scene.

### Strahan and Queenstown (West Coast)

The West Coast is known for its mining history, rugged landscapes, and the Gordon River
Cruise from Strahan. Explore the remnants of the mining boom in Queenstown, hike
to Nelson Falls, and take in the views from Hogarth Falls. The West Coast Wilderness
Railway is another great way to experience the region's history and scenery. Cruise
up the river from Strahan to see the ancient huon pine forests.

### Bay of Fires (East Coast)

The Bay of Fires, stretching from Binalong Bay to Eddystone Point, is famous for its
white sand beaches, turquoise waters, and orange lichen-covered boulders. It's a great
spot for hiking, swimming, fishing, and kayaking. Stay in one of the beachside campgrounds
or eco-lodges to fully immerse yourself in the coastal beauty. On the way there from Hobart,
you can stop at Bicheno for a lobster roll.

### Maria Island

Maria Island is a national park and wildlife sanctuary accessible by ferry from
Triabunna. Known for its stunning landscapes, historic ruins, and abundant wildlife
(including wombats and Tasmanian devils), it's perfect for hiking and exploring.
The Painted Cliffs and the Fossil Cliffs are highlights of the island.
