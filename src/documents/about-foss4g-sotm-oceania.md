## FOSS4G SotM Oceania - Yeah, we know that's a mouthful. Here's what it means.

So let's break it down — '**Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial**' or **FOSS4G**
if you're a fan of efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open
Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). OSGeo is a non-profit with a mission to foster and
promote the adoption of open source geospatial technology. All of this is done within
the broader context of open source software philosophy and participatory community
driven development.

'**State of the Map**' or **SotM** is the conference of the **OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF)** which supports the development of a free and open editable
world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap project.

'**Oceania**' – no acronyms here – This is the part of the world which is
quite, well, ocean-y. Think Moana. Technically, Wikipedia tells us it's the
geographic region made up of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.
