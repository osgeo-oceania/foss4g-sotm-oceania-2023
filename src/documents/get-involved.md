## Session MCs
Session MCs are integral to running a successful conference. <br />
They are responsible for:
- **Setting the tone of sessions:** Engage your audience to be open to what they are about to hear. Add your passion. 
- **Managing the speakers:** Ensuring all the talks are loaded and ready to go. The program team will have done most of this, but best to check it.
- **Tech support:** Help the speakers with any tech issues.
- **Introducing the speakers:** Give a quick bio and introduce the talk.
- **Inviting and moderating the questions:** at the end of the talk there is 5 minutes for questions. The MC is to entice the audience to ask questions and should have back up questions themselves if the audience is quite shy. 
- **Ensuring the talks start on time and finish on time:** Yes, you will be the TimeLord for a session. Talks start on time, not before it, but on the time. This makes sure if  people are moving between rooms, they don't miss the start. You will have a bell to give 5 minutes warning at the 15 minute mark. Talks are for 20 minutes with a 5 minute question time at the end of the talk. 

> If you would like to be a session MC, please email the following to the [program team](mailto:program@foss4g-oceania.org):
>  - Your name
>  - Preferred session(s): you can MC as many as you want

Once we have confirmed your MC spot, we will send you more detailed instructions but the main actions you will need to do are: 
- Make contact with your speakers - either before the conference or at the Icebreaker
- Meet your speakers 10min before the session
- Get acquainted with the tech as you will be troubleshooting any issues
- You will have a Student Volunteer who will be your runner if you need help
- Ring that bell
- Be the TimeLord
